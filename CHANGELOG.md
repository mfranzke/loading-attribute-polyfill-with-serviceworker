It's the [olders brothers polyfills](https://github.com/mfranzke/loading-attribute-polyfill) birthday (okay, it has been yesterday), so I did a lot of housekeeping, so that's a perfect timing to release this polyfill with another concept (using Service Worker to prevent loading images and iframes contents). Check it out and evaluate its usage in your project.
